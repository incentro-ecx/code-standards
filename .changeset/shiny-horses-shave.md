Merged the original source of this repository (part of the `micro.nova`) project into this project. This includes an upgrade to the latest Prettier version, updates to its dependencies, and fixes compatibility with PNPM version 10. It also includes [a **breaking** upgrade of the `prettier-plugin-organize-imports` plugin when formatting with Vue](https://github.com/simonhaenisch/prettier-plugin-organize-imports/releases/tag/v4.0.0).
