Merged the original source of this repository (part of the `micro.nova` project) into this project. This includes **breaking** changes to various Typescript configs, updates their entrypoints, and removes the `docusaurus` config. In the merger the `react-router` Typescript wasn't copied because it was based on experimental RSC features for React Router.
