Merged the original source of this repository (part of the `micro.nova` project) into this project. This includes an upgrade to the latest ESLint version, updates to its dependencies. It also reverts back from using `eslint-plugin-import-x` to `eslint-plugin-import`, and adds the [CSpell ESLint plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cspell/eslint-plugin) and the [Vitest ESLint plugin](https://github.com/vitest-dev/eslint-plugin-vitest).
